# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the project is pre-1.0, minor versions may still change behaviour.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Live audio from cameras.** The live grid, a maximized pane and pop-out
  windows can now play the camera's sound. In the grid, sound follows the
  selected tile (the one with the accent border): click a tile to hear it, and
  the previous one goes silent, so only one camera is ever audible. A small
  speaker marks the tile you are hearing. Pop-out windows start muted with a
  speaker button in the corner. Works over both RTSP (grid tiles) and native
  Baichuan (HD/maximized). AAC and G.711/PCM are decoded and resampled to
  48 kHz stereo; muted panes decode no audio at all. Output follows the system
  default (e.g. Bluetooth headphones). Recorded clips and playback are still
  video-only.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Playback failed with a black screen that retried forever** on systems with
  FFmpeg 8 or newer. Reolink devices serve HTTPS with a self-signed
  certificate, which the app has always accepted; FFmpeg 8.0 changed its
  default to reject it. Live view was unaffected because it uses RTSP. This
  only ever hit builds from source (Arch and other current distros) — the
  AppImage and Flatpak bundle an older FFmpeg — but it would have reached
  those too as their base images move forward.
- **Playback stopped dead at every event marker.** The NVR streams one
  recording file per connection and stores motion events as separate files, so
  continuous footage ended exactly where an event began. Playback now
  continues across recording boundaries automatically.
- **Removing a device and adding it back left its header stuck** on the first
  camera's name and "connecting…" forever, and a re-add could briefly show
  "undefined" in place of the camera count.

### Changed

- Clicking an event now starts playback **5 seconds before** the moment, so the
  approach is visible rather than only the aftermath.

### Internal

- Continuous integration: every push and pull request now builds and runs the
  test suite, including a second build against the newest Qt and FFmpeg so
  upstream changes surface before they reach anyone building from source.
- New regression test covering the TLS behaviour above.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-08-05

### Added

- Per-camera view rotation: right-click a camera in the sidebar →
  **Rotate view 90°** turns its picture in 90° steps, persisted per camera
  and applied in live view and both playback modes — for devices whose
  firmware misreports orientation. ([#3])

### Fixed

- HD live view failed ("Could not find codec parameters") on cameras whose
  newer firmware doesn't report the main-stream codec the way the app
  expected — it assumed H.264 and choked on H.265 streams. The codec report
  is now normalized across firmware spellings, and when it's genuinely
  unknown the stream is probed instead of assumed. ([#4])
- Cameras attached through a Home Hub could show rotated 90° because the hub
  declares their resolution transposed while the stream arrives upright; the
  auto-rotation heuristic now also requires the decoded frame to actually be
  portrait before correcting. ([#3])

## [0.1.6] — 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Synced multi-camera playback**: a 4-pane playback grid driven by one
  calendar and one timeline, like the official client's split playback. The
  timeline shows the union of every camera's recordings with a thin coverage
  lane per camera, and one playhead drives all panes to the same wall-clock
  moment; a camera with no footage there says so instead of looking broken.
- Playback grid interactions: drag cameras in from the sidebar or between
  panes (swaps, never drops), double-click to maximize a pane and again to
  restore, digital zoom with drag-to-pan in every pane, and an SD/HD toggle
  on the maximized pane that plays the full-resolution main stream with
  in-place seeking.
- Live view: drag cameras from the sidebar into any grid cell and drag panes
  between cells to rearrange; the arrangement persists across restarts.
- Sidebar recovery actions: right-click a device for **Reconnect** and
  **Update credentials…** — fix a wrong password in place instead of
  removing and re-adding the device.

### Fixed

- A device that was unreachable when the app started stayed "connecting…"
  forever; unreachable devices now retry automatically with backoff and
  recover on their own. Sign-in failures are shown with the device's
  attempts-left lockout warning and are deliberately never auto-retried.
- Adding a device now checks it first: a wrong address or rejected password
  is an inline message in the dialog instead of a phantom row.
- Rearranging grids no longer reconnects running streams — panes carry their
  streams with them, in live view and playback both. Restoring a maximized
  view reconnects nothing.
- Switching live-view layouts briefly holds hidden panes' streams so flipping
  between presets (or maximize and back) is instant.
- Concurrent commands to a device are now queued instead of racing, which
  was the main source of the NVR web server's intermittent 502 errors.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- **Launching the app again raises the running window instead of starting a
  second copy.** Because closing the window leaves the app monitoring in the
  tray, relaunching from the launcher is the normal way back in — but every
  launch used to build a whole second client, with its own tray icon, NVR login
  and decoder set. They accumulated over a day of use.
- **Hardware video decoding now works in the AppImage.** The bundled `libva`
  could not load the host's VAAPI driver, so every stream silently fell back to
  software decode. The host's own `libva` is now used, with the bundled copy
  kept as a fallback so the app still starts on systems that have none.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-08-01

### Added

- System tray with background monitoring — close to tray, start on login, and
  an unread-event badge, so detection alerts keep working with the window shut.
- Offline and online alerts for cameras and for the NVR itself.
- Real thumbnails for each event in the inbox, and filtering events by camera.
- Detection events marked as red ticks on the playback timeline.
- Clip export — save the recording around the playhead to a file.
- Weekly recording-schedule editor: a 7×24 grid per recording type.

### Fixed

- Tray **Quit** always exits the app, instead of only removing the tray icon.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- Clicking a detection notification opens the app, switches to Playback and
  plays that event back.
- The app version is shown in the nav bar.

### Fixed

- Clicking a notification now raises the window on Wayland. The compositor
  ignores a bare activation request as focus stealing, so the notification
  daemon's activation token is forwarded instead.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- The AppImage runs natively on Wayland instead of falling back to XWayland;
  it now bundles the Qt Wayland platform and EGL client-buffer plugins.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- Detection-zone editor — paint the parts of the image a camera should ignore.
- 6-camera live grid.
- Desktop notifications for detections, gated on each camera's Push setting.
- Built-in update checker, with one-click self-update for the AppImage.
- Event retention cap so the inbox stops growing without bound.

### Changed

- Device tree nests cameras under their NVR, with drawn NVR/camera icons and
  clearer online status.
- Right-click menus and the Add Device dialog restyled to match the rest of
  the app.
